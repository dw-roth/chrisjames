Chris paid close attention to my reactions to the homes we visited and began to tailor our next visits according to those without me making any specfic requests, often saying something like \"I knew you would like these floors!\" or \"This will be a great yard for the dog!\" He referred me to a wonderful network of professionals that all truly worked together to make my first home purchase truly a breeze. And when Chris told me to stay in touch in case I had any further questions, needed any guidance or additional referrals, or ANYTHING, he genuinely meant it! I would absolutely not hesitate to recommend Chris James as a real estate agent to anyone looking to purchase a home!"
